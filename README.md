# DefectDojo Community Contributions

Welcome to the DefectDojo community!

This is a starting point for joining and contributing to the DefectDojo community - a place primarily for more creative and specific use case contributions. Such contributions could be implemented in code, documentation, or any other way.

Examples include alternative methods to deploy DefectDojo, specific docker/kubernetes/container methods or configs, alternative deployments like using Rabbit MQ instead of Celery, etc.

We've gotten loads of these and created this repo so those contributions and alternatives could be shared with the broader DefectDojo community (plus the contributors can get the props they deserve).

In future and if the community rallies around the alternatives here, it's quite possible they will move into the main DefectDOjo repo.  The idea is to allow alternatives to get exposure and community engagement before bringing them into the main repo.  

Additionally, some of the contributions here may answer very specific use cases that are valid but not generally applicable to the overall DefectDojo community.  

## Contribute

(EXAMPLE) Ansible to deploy defect Dojo in various ways

This contribution provides 3 different ways to install DefectDojo using Ansible:

* A dev install where all the parts of DefectDojo are installed on a single OS
* prod-install where the database is separated from the DefectDojo installation
* A legacy install - an older method of installing DefectDojo
